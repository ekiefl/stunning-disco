    Splices sample_id in the SNV table to easily filter samples and cohorts

    This use of this function splices the sample_id column into 2 columns in
    order to easily filter or group the table according to cohort or
    environmental conditions. Obviously, this method relies on the fact that
    cohort or environmental information is embedded in your sample names.
    Ideally, you named your samples to contain some tag of your cohort,
    followed by some sample number or environmental condition. For example,
    let's suppose you collect 3 samples each for 2 patients. If your samples
    were named ABC1, ABC2, ABC3, DEF1, DEF2, and DEF3, then this method creates
    2 columns `cohort` and `envrionment` that look like:

    sample_id     cohort     environment
    ABC1          ABC        1
    ABC2          ABC        2
    ABC3          ABC        3
    DEF1          DEF        1
    DEF2          DEF        2
    DEF3          DEF        3

    This illustrates the default behaviour of this method. It splices sample_id
    at the last non-digit character. If your sample_id is more complicated,
    `sep` must be provided (see Attributes). For example, suppose your sample
    names are PATIENT1_GUT, PATIENT1_ORAL, PATIENT2_GUT, and PATIENT2_ORAL.
    Then with sep="_", the method creates 2 columns `cohort` and `environment`
    that look like:

    sample_id      cohort     environment
    PATIENT1_GUT   PATIENT1   GUT
    PATIENT1_ORAL  PATIENT1   ORAL
    PATIENT2_GUT   PATIENT2   GUT
    PATIENT2_ORAL  PATIENT2   ORAL

    NOTE: If the resultant column is ALL digit characters, the column is converted
    from a string column to an int column
